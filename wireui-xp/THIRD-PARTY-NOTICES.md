# Third-Party Notices

This crate (the wireui pure-Rust engine) contains source code derived from the
third-party project below. Its copyright notice and license are reproduced in

Portions of this crate are derived from sciter-rs so that unmodified client code
compiles and runs against this engine:

- `src/macros.rs`: the `make_args!` and `dispatch_script_call!` macros
- `src/capi/mod.rs`, `src/capi/scbehavior.rs`, `src/capi/scdef.rs`,
  `src/capi/scdom.rs`, `src/capi/sctypes.rs`: the Sciter C-API type layer
